# Web App for CalAnswers Database
I used the following link as a reference:
https://codehandbook.org/creating-a-web-app-using-angularjs-python-mongodb/

Run the Python Flask App from the answers directory using:
```python3 pythonFlaskApp.py```
Go to your browser and navigate to
```http://localhost:5000/```

The .csv files in this directory can be used for uploading on the web app.
